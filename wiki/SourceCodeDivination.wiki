Diviner can represent application behaviors in different methods; 
One of these methods is conversion into a source code representation of the application logic and behaviors.

The following rules are currently used to convert behaviors into server-side pseudo code:

<TABLE border="1" cellspacing="10">
<TR>
<TD><B>Plugin</B></TD>
<TD><B>Behavior</B></TD>
<TD><B>Code</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
