Diviner is an active information gathering platform, implemented as an extension for the interception proxy OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (<a href=http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/>ZAP</a>).<br><br>

The platform can be used to identify abnormal and complex vulnerabilities in web application, through the use of various features designed to "predict" the structure of server side resources.<br><br>

The information obtained through the "divination" process can then be used to isolate suspicious behaviors and identify scenarios and sequences that are required to reproduce them. <br><br>
